# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ZrzUkh3NupJhXmMYBG_x4Iou8jru9rVX_ejEZHgXqM/edit?usp=sharing

- woodNamesArray (String array) - Names of wooden roller coasters.
- steelSpeedsArray (double array) - Speeds of steel roller coasters.
- woodSpeedsArray (double array) - Speeds of wooden roller coasters.
- colorsArray (String array) - A set of colors used for visual elements in the data scene.

## Description

This project is an abstract data visualization that uses roller coaster speed data. It visualizes the speeds and names of steel and wooden roller coasters, highlighting the fastest ones with special messages. The program calculates averages and identifies the fastest coasters using algorithms. Randomization is applied to visual elements, making the display interactive and visually appealing. The goal is to allow viewers to explore the relationship between coaster speeds through a creative and informative representation of the data.
